# My Portfolio

## Description
Work In Progress

This project features a mockup of a classic Windows XP interface, complete with a command-line interface (CLI) window.  
If you're not familiar with Bash, you can type `help` in the CLI to get guidance. Alternatively, click the desktop icons for a more user-friendly navigation experience.
